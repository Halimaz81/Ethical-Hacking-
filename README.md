# Ethical-Hacking-
This project conducts a structured penetration test to demonstrate how an attacker could compromise an enterprise network. Starting from a public-facing Windows Server, multiple attack techniques such as service enumeration, credential attacks, exploitation of CVE-2024-43451, and lateral movement are performed to gain deeper access into the internal network. Post-exploitation activities including credential dumping, registry hive extraction, persistence mechanisms, and data exfiltration are carried out to showcase potential impact. The project concludes with remediation and defensive measures to highlight how such attacks can be detected, mitigated, and prevented in real-world environments.
